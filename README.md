# ExanimaSavegameManager
A savegame Backup tool for Exanima

Exanima by http://www.baremettle.com/ is a great game. If you want more control over your savegame files, this tool is for you.

The tool monitors Exanima's savegame folder for updates and generates a backup every time a savegame is created or updated. In the inevitable event that unpleasant things happen to your character in the game, you can just "restore" an older savegame.

## Usage
coming soon

## Note
Exanima only saves you progress when exiting the game. It is recommended that you completely exit the game to save your progress and create a new backup file.

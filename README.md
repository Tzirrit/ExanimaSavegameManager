# A savegame backup tool for Exanima

Exanima by http://www.baremettle.com/ is a great game. If you want more control over your savegame files, this tool is for you.

The tool monitors Exanimas savegame folder for updates and generates a backup every time a savegame is created or updated. In the inevitable event that unpleasant things happen, you can just "restore" an older savegame.

## Usage
coming soon

## Note
This tool monitors .rsg files only.
Exanima only saves progress when exiting the game. It is recommended that you completely exit the game to save your progress and create a new backup file.
